# Solulab

A framework for systematically testing and comparing multiple implementations of the same functionality. Solulab helps developers make data-driven decisions by running different solution versions against the same test cases and tracking results over time.

## Structure

- **`solulab/`** - The Solulab framework library
  - Framework for testing multiple solution implementations
  - CLI tool for running labs
  - Web UI for visualizing results
  
- **`solulab-demo/`** - Demo project using Solulab
  - Example labs showing how to use the framework
  - Real database generated by the CLI

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm run install:all

# Run labs in demo project
npm run demo:run

# Start development UI
npm run dev

# Reset demo database
npm run demo:reset
```

## Development

The UI in development mode will automatically use the demo project's database, showing real data from actual lab runs.
